	<p>
		We are four students who are interested in the evolution of the Internet in the upcoming years. 
		Web3 envisions a more open, decentralized, and secure Internet, which our generation will fully
		be immersed in. To allow for an easier transition into this radically different Internet, we 
		designed this website to provide users a simple, introductory explanation of the various aspects
		of Web3 that will be important for all people to understand fundamentally. We hope you enjoy, and
		welcome to the future!
